# Abstraction
This is a C++ command-line application that simulates the functionality of the popular expense-sharing app 'Splitwise', also featuring the implementation of the OOP concept of abstraction.
The application helps users keep track of expenses among a group of people and calculates the amounts owed between individuals.

## Features
User Input: The application allows users to input the total number of payees and members involved in the expense-sharing.

Expense Entry: Users can enter the names of payees and the amount paid by each payee. They can also enter the names of other members of the group.

Calculations: The application performs calculations to determine who owes how much and how much is to be returned to each individual.

Expense Distribution: The application also calculates the fair share for each member, ensuring that the expenses are distributed evenly among all members.

Compilation: Compile the C++ source code using a C++ compiler. For example:
   ```sh
   g++ -o abstraction.exe abstraction.cpp

Run: Run the code using the following command:

 ./abstraction.exe
